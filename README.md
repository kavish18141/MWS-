## Description

This repository contains the executed Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) source files for the Continuous Assessment 1 (CA1). The project consists of 5 case studies demonstrating various network topologies, routing strategies (RIP, Static), and wireless sensor network designs.

## Repository Contents

### Case Study 1: Disaster-Recovery Wired Ad Hoc Network
Demonstrates a decentralized mesh topology using dynamic routing (RIP) to ensure connectivity during link failures.
- **File:** `Case study 1.pkt`

### Case Study 2: Energy-Constrained Data Collection Network
Compares direct transmission versus aggregated transmission. Includes a bonus Wireless Sensor Network implementation.
- **File:** `Case study 2- DIrect.pkt` (Design 1: Direct Transmission)
- **File:** `Case study 2 - Aggregated.pkt` (Design 2: Wired Aggregation)
- **File:** `Case study 2 - Aggregated - Wireless.pkt` (Bonus: Wireless Implementation)

### Case Study 3: Logical Location Discovery Without GPS
Demonstrates how nodes estimate logical distance from an anchor node using hop counts.
- **File:** `Case study 3.pkt`

### Case Study 4: In-Network Processing vs Raw Data Forwarding
Compares the performance and congestion of sending raw data versus processed (aggregated) data in a smart agriculture scenario.
- **File:** `Case study 4 - Raw.pkt` (Configuration 1: Raw Data)
- **File:** `Case study 4 - Aggregation.pkt` (Configuration 2: In-Network Aggregation)

### Case Study 5: Routing Strategy Under Link Failure
Compares Static Routing behavior against Dynamic Routing during link failure conditions.
- **File:** `Case study 5 - Static.pkt` (Static Routing Configuration)
- **Note:** For the Dynamic Routing comparison, refer to `Case study 1.pkt`


## Tools Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **Routing Protocols:** RIPv2, Static Routing

## How to Use
1. Open the respective `.pkt` files in Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Run simulations to observe network behavior
3. Compare different configurations as outlined in each case study
